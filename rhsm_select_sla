CLASSES
    
    class moduleClass(firstboot.module.Module)
     |  
     |  
     |  __init__(self)
     |      Create a new Module instance.  This method must be provided by
     |      all subclasses.  Of the following instance attributes, only icon
     |      is not required.  The module loader will check that all required
     |      attributes are present and defined.  Instance attributes;
     |      
     |      icon         -- No longer used.
     |      mode         -- The mode of firstboot operation that this module
     |                      should appear in.  MODE_REGULAR means the module
     |                      will appear only in the regular running mode.
     |                      MODE_RECONFIG means the module will appear in both
     |                      regular mode and reconfig mode.
     |      priority     -- An integer specifying the order in which this module
     |                      should be loaded and appear in firstboot.  The lower
     |                      the priority number, the earlier this module will
     |                      be loaded and run.  All modules with the same
     |                      priority will then be ordered alphabetically by
     |                      title.
     |      sidebarTitle -- A brief word or phrase that will appear on the
     |                      firstboot sidebar on the left side of the screen.
     |      title        -- The title of the module that will appear on the
     |                      right side of the screen above the module when it
     |                      is displayed.  The title is shown in large bold
     |                      letters.
     |      vbox         -- A gtk.VBox that contains all the widgets for this
     |                      module.  The vbox will be wrapped in various other
     |                      widgets to present a consistent look and placed
     |                      on the right side of the screen when the module is
     |                      displayed.
     |  
     |  apply(self, interface, testing=False)
     |      'Next' button has been clicked - autobind controller will have 
     |      already stored the selected sla
     |  
     |  createScreen(self)
     |      Create a new instance of gtk.VBox, pulling in child widgets 
     |      from the glade file.
     |  
     |  initializeUI(self)
     |      Synchronize the state of the UI with whatever's present on disk
     |      or wherever else the module looks for its default values.  This
     |      method will be called immediately before the module is 
     |      displayed, both when moving forwards and backwards through the 
     |      module list. It should be designed to be called multiple times.
     |      This method must be provided by all subclasses.
     |  
     |  needsNetwork(self)
     |      This lets firstboot know that networking is required, in order 
     |      to talk to hosted UEP.
     |  
     |  shouldAppear(self)
     |      Indicates to firstboot whether to show this screen.  In this 
     |      case we want to skip over this screen if there is already an 
     |      identity certificate on the machine (most likely laid down in a
     |      kickstart).
