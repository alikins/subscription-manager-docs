CLASSES
    
    class moduleClass(firstboot.module.Module, subscription_manager.gui.registergui.RegisterScreen)
     |  
     |  
     |  __init__(self)
     |      Create a new firstboot Module for the 'register' screen.
     |  
     |  _read_rhn_proxy_settings(self)
     |  
     |  apply(self, interface, testing=False)
     |      'Next' button has been clicked - try to register with the 
     |      provided user credentials and return the appropriate result 
     |      value.
     |  
     |  close_window(self)
     |      Overridden from RegisterScreen - we want to bypass the default 
     |      behavior of hiding the GTK window.
     |  
     |  emit_consumer_signal(self)
     |      Overriden from RegisterScreen - we don't care about consumer 
     |      update signals.
     |  
     |  registrationTokenScreen(self)
     |      Overridden from RegisterScreen - ignore any requests to show 
     |      the registration screen on this particular page.
     |  
     |  createScreen(self)
     |      Create a new instance of gtk.VBox, pulling in child widgets 
     |      from the glade file.
     |  
     |  initializeUI(self)
     |      Synchronize the state of the UI with whatever's present on disk
     |      or wherever else the module looks for its default values.  This
     |      method will be called immediately before the module is 
     |      displayed, both when moving forwards and backwards through the 
     |      module list. It should be designed to be called multiple times.
     |      This method must be provided by all subclasses.
     |  
     |  needsNetwork(self)
     |      This lets firstboot know that networking is required, in order 
     |      to talk to hosted UEP.
     |  
     |  focus(self)
     |      Focus the initial UI element on the page, in this case the 
     |      login name field.
     |  
     |  shouldAppear(self)
     |      Indicates to firstboot whether to show this screen.  In this 
     |      case we want to skip over this screen if there is already an 
     |      identity certificate on the machine (most likely laid down in a
     |      kickstart).
     |  
     |  _destroy_widget(self, widget_name)
     |      Destroy a widget by name.
     |      
     |      See gtk.Widget.destroy()
     |  
     |  _get_credentials_hash(self)
     |      Return an internal hash representation of the text input 
     |      widgets.  This is used to compare if we have changed anything 
     |      when moving back and forth across modules.
     |  
     |  _get_text(self, widget_name)
     |      Return the text value of an input widget referenced by name.
     |  
     |  _finish_registration(self, failed=False)
     |  
     |  _move_to_manual_install(self, title)
     |  
     |  _init_sla(self)
     |  
     |  Inherited methods
     |      firstboot.module.Module.needsReboot(self)
     |      firstboot.module.Module.renderModule(self, interface)
