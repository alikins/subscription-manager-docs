CLASSES
    
    class moduleClass(firstboot.module.Module)
     |  
     |  
     |  __init__(self)
     |      Create a new Module instance.  This method must be provided by
     |      all subclasses.  Of the following instance attributes, only icon
     |      is not required.  The module loader will check that all required
     |      attributes are present and defined.  Instance attributes;
     |      
     |      icon         -- No longer used.
     |      mode         -- The mode of firstboot operation that this module
     |                      should appear in.  MODE_REGULAR means the module
     |                      will appear only in the regular running mode.
     |                      MODE_RECONFIG means the module will appear in both
     |                      regular mode and reconfig mode.
     |      priority     -- An integer specifying the order in which this module
     |                      should be loaded and appear in firstboot.  The lower
     |                      the priority number, the earlier this module will
     |                      be loaded and run.  All modules with the same
     |                      priority will then be ordered alphabetically by
     |                      title.
     |      sidebarTitle -- A brief word or phrase that will appear on the
     |                      firstboot sidebar on the left side of the screen.
     |      title        -- The title of the module that will appear on the
     |                      right side of the screen above the module when it
     |                      is displayed.  The title is shown in large bold
     |                      letters.
     |      vbox         -- A gtk.VBox that contains all the widgets for this
     |                      module.  The vbox will be wrapped in various other
     |                      widgets to present a consistent look and placed
     |                      on the right side of the screen when the module is
     |                      displayed.
     |  
     |  apply(self, interface, testing=False)
     |      Called when the Next button is clicked on the interface.  This
     |      method takes whatever action is appropriate based on the state
     |      of the UI.  This can include writing things to disk or running
     |      programs.  apply should return one of the following values:
     |      
     |      RESULT_FAILURE -- Return this value if firstboot should not move
     |                        to the next screen.  This is commonly used when
     |                        a module displays a yes/no question, and the user
     |                        selects no so the module must present its screen
     |                        again.
     |      RESULT_SUCCESS -- Return this value if everything worked.  This
     |                        tells firstboot that it should advance to the
     |                        next module.
     |      RESULT_JUMP    -- Return this value if the module called
     |                        interface.moveToPage.  This tells firstboot to
     |                        not automatically advance to the next module.
     |                        Otherwise, the page your module advanced to will
     |                        be skipped.
     |      
     |      This method must be provided by all subclasses.  Arguments:
     |      
     |      interface -- A reference to the running Interface class.
     |      testing   -- If True, this method must not make any permanent
     |                   changes to disk.
     |  
     |  createScreen(self)
     |      Create a new instance of gtk.VBox, the UI elements required for
     |      this module, and pack them into self.vbox.  Do not take any 
     |      action to initialize the UI elements or write anything to disk.
     |      This method does not return any value, and is the first method 
     |      called on a module after it is loaded.  This method must be 
     |      provided by all subclasses.
     |  
     |  initializeUI(self)
     |      Synchronize the state of the UI with whatever's present on disk
     |      or wherever else the module looks for its default values.  This
     |      method will be called immediately before the module is 
     |      displayed, both when moving forwards and backwards through the 
     |      module list. It should be designed to be called multiple times.
     |      This method must be provided by all subclasses.
     |  
     |  needsNetwork(self)
     |      Does this module require the network to be active in order to 
     |      run? By default, no modules need networking.  If the module 
     |      requires networking which is not available, the module will not
     |      be presented. Modules that require networking should override 
     |      this method.
     |  
     |  shouldAppear(self)
     |      Indicates to firstboot whether to show this screen.  In this 
     |      case we want to skip over this screen if there is already an 
     |      identity certificate on the machine (most likely laid down in a
     |      kickstart).
     |  
     |  _skip_sla_screens(self, interface)
     |      
     |      Find the first non rhsm module after the rhsm modules, and move to it.
     |      
     |      Assumes that only our modules are grouped together, and that we have
     |      4.
